# Pokemon DS Map Studio
![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/Trifindo/Pokemon-DS-Map-Studio/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=master)

Pokemon DS Map Studio is a tool for creating NDS Pokémon maps, designed to be used alongside SDSME.

It doesn't require 3D modeling knowledge. Rather, it provides a tilemap-like interface that is automatically converted to a 3D model. Please note that this tool **DOES NOT** allow modification of maps from official games.



### WARNING !
As soon as you resave your existing PDSMAP files with this new version, backward compatibility with other PDSMS versions (including Trifindo's vanilla PDSMS) will most likely be lost. 
This is due to the additional 3D layer, and the new "exportgroup" and "egcenter" keywords in PDSMAP files, necessary to make Export Groups work.


### Supported games:
- Pokemon Diamond/Pearl
- Pokemon Platinum
- Pokemon Heart Gold/Soul Silver
- Pokemon Black/White
- Pokemon Black 2/ White 2

## Requirements
*   **Java 21**: Required to run the application.
*   **Python**: Required for 3D model conversion (via `converter.py`). Ensure `python` is in your system's PATH.

## Running
Pokemon DS Map Studio has been tested under Windows, Linux and MacOS.
In order to run it, Java 21 and Python must be installed on your computer.

Pokemon DS Map Studio can be executed by double clicking the "PokemonDsMapStudio.jar" file. 

If it doesn't open, try typing the following command in a terminal:
```shell
java -jar PokemonDSMapStudio.jar
```
and look at the output.

## Building from Source
This project uses Git submodules for dependencies. To clone the repository with all components, use:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/perspace42/Pokemon-DS-Map-Studio.git
```
To build the project and package it with the latest converter:
```shell
./gradlew installDist
```
The application and its dependencies will be located in `build/install/Pokemon-DS-Map-Studio/`.

On Linux, the installation can be done directly in an automated way, just open a terminal and type:
```shell
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdAstra-LD/Pokemon-DS-Map-Studio/master/pdsms-linux.sh)"
```
